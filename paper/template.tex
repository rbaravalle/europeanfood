\begin{abstract}
Adequate image descriptors are fundamental in image classification and object recognition. Main requirements for image features are robustness and low dimensionality which would lead to low classification errors in a variety of situations and with a reasonable computational cost.

In this context, the identification of materials poses a significant challenge, since typical (geometric and/or differential) feature extraction methods are not robust enough. Texture features based on Fourier or wavelet transforms, on the other hand, do withstand geometric and illumination variations, but tend to require a high amount of descriptors to perform adequately. 

Recently, the theory of fractal sets has shown to provide local image features that are both robust and low-dimensional. In this work we apply fractal and multifractal feature extraction techniques for bread crumb classification based on colour scans of slices of different bread types. Preliminary results show that fractal based classification is able to distinguish different bread crumbs with very high accuracy.

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
Fractal and multifractal analysis of images have proved to capture useful properties of the underlying material being represented. Characterisation of images using these features have been successfully applied in different areas, such as medicine (\cite{Andjelkovic2008,Yu2011}) and texture classification (\cite{Wendt2009}). Through several procedures, it is possible to obtain different Fractal Dimensions (FD), each of them capturing a different property of the material ({\em e.g.}, void image fraction, rugosity).

For each material, the results obtained in the classification process are useful in quality measurements of real samples and also in the validation of synthetic representations of them. In other words, the classification is useful to determine if a given image presents the observed features in that material, allowing to associate quality measure parameters to the material. In~\cite{Fan2006}, a quality bread crumb test based on Gabor filters was performed in that paper, obtaining good results. Nevertheless, a small database was used ($30$ images). In \cite{Gonzales2008} several fractal features were obtained for one type of bread, showing that a vector comprising them would be capable of obtaining key features of its crumb texture.

In this work we propose the application of fractal and multifractal descriptors for the classification of different bread types and for the discrimination between bread and non-bread images. The proposed method is compared to a classifier that uses only mean colour information. The results of this feature extraction procedure show that the classifier is robust and presents good discrimination properties to distinguish between bread and non bread images. In section 2 we briefly introduce the theory underlying fractal sets. In section 3 we describe the materials and methods employed in the classification. In section 4 we show the results obtained in the classification and we perform a robustness analysis of the method. In section 5 we summarise the conclusions, and we pose some possible future works.
